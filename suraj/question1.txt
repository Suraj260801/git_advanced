What is cherry-pick?
Cherry-picking in Git stands for applying some commit from one branch into another branch. In case you made a mistake and committed a change into the wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch. You can revert the commit and apply it on another branch.

Use Cases
1.It is a handy tool for team collaboration.
2.It is necessary in case of bug fixing because bugs are fixed and tested in the development branch with their commits.
3.It is mostly used in undoing changes and restoring lost commits.
4.You can avoid useless conflicts by using git cherry-pick instead of other options.

Steps
1.git log 
use this command to get id of commit where we made mistake.
2.git checkout branc_name
switch to desired branch from current branch
3.git cherry-pick commit_id
this command applies changes to desired branch by restoring previous commit.
